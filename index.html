<div>
Professor Campesato did a great job presenting deep learning material in the context of the Tensorflow framework, which was impressive given that it’s relatively still rather new and has yet to be adopted across many industries and academic settings.  Course material was well organized with ample amounts of experimental and sample code to run.  Explanations could have been a little less hand-wavy and more detailed, but given the wide variance and broad backgrounds of many of the class participants, this was understandable that it had to err on the side of generality rather than specificity.  Professor Campesato definitely has a lot of knowledge in this area and definitely keeps up to date with the cutting edge tech and frameworks being used at the leading deep learning companies, and is always talking about the latest papers he’s read and the latest conferences and meetups he’s attended / would like us to attend.  Overall, this class was great.

Professor Campesato has a thorough understating of TensorFlow.
The course had to cater to professionals who only have evenings to devote
to the course material, otherwise, I am sure he could have constructed even
more challenging problems sets.

I enjoyed the course. Oswald is very knowledgeable about the course content and, on the occasion he doesn't know an answer to a question, he researches it and comes to the next class with a well-informed answer.
